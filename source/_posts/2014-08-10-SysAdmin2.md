## General information

1. Use `uname` to get system information:

    uname -a
    
   `-a` for print all the information.

## CPU information

1. Use `nproc` to print the number of processing units available (GNU coreutils):

     
       $ nproc
	   4
	
	
2. Use `lscpu` to display CPU architecture information (util-linux).

## Disk information

1. `df` is a powerful command for displaying system disk.

       
        df -h /path/to/directory
       
2. `cat /proc/partitions/` and `cat /proc/mounts` are also pretty handly solutions to check the partitions and mount disks.

## Memory information

1. Just as same as disk, `cat /proc/meminfo` could easily check memory information (Thanks to Unix's [**Everything is a file**][ef] design concept).

2. Alternatively, you can type `free -m`, which essentially is the same as check /meminfo. `-m` for display in megabytes (as you expected, -g for gigabytes, -k for kilobytes.)

## User activity information
1. `last` command will display user's info like terminal, time, date and so forth. To check one specific user's activity, `last username` is what you are looking for.


2. `w` is a great but rarely know command. It will display who is logged on and what they are doing. It'll show username, terminal, from IP, login time, idle time, JCPU and the  command line of their current process. If you never heard it before, I strongly suggest you to have a try.

3. `uptime`: Tell how long the system has been running.

4. `ps`: a well known command for checking current processes, for instance, to list all zombie process:

        ps aux | awk '{ print $8 " " $2 }' | grep -w Z
        
    where `ps aux` to show processes for **a**ll users, the process's **u**ser, and also show the processes not attached to a terminal (check man page for more details), then awk to filter the `STAT` and PID field, use grep to select the line contains `Z`(Zombie), now we get zombie processes pids. It's easy to kill them by `kill -9 {PID}`.


5. `top/htop`: Better not to use non-builtin command(for security reasons), but if you do want to, `htop` is a superior alternative to `top` -- dynamically display current tasks.

## Network information
1. To get your own public IP, both `curl icanhazip.com` or `curl ifconfig.me` are easy ways to do that(previous one is much faster).

2. `ping`: Even my mother knows to use `ping` to check network connectivity.

3. `ifconfig`: A frequently used tool to view network interface information. BTW, I wrote a [script][Ifconfig] to filter IP, MAC addresses and networks from `ifconfig` (tested on Ubuntu, Fedora, OmniOS and FreeBSD).

3. `lsof`, aka list open files, is definitely a swiss army knife for analyzing network. `lsof -i` for list all open Internet and X.25 network files. (The examples below are from Daniel Miessler's blog, see reference)

        lsof -iTCP # Show only TCP connections
        lsof -i:80 # Show networking only relate to port 80
        lsof -i@107.170.181.47 # Show connections with particular IP
        lsof -u username # Show given user's connections
        lsof -u ^username # Show connections except given user
        

3. `ss -s`: display Currently Established, Closed, Orphaned and Waiting TCP sockets
